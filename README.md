# COSC-310-Assignment2
## A brief description of our project: <br>
Our project is a simple and friendly chat-bot with which the user can talk about their hobbies, interests etc.  We are using the chat bot as a friend but in most cases these days these bots are used for customer service. Keeping in mind the recent pandemic and how it has changed everyone’s social lives. A virtual “friend” is able to make normal conversations and allows the user to chat to this bot anytime and share their experiences when their friends are busy or for the people who have a hard time socialising.
<br>
We have used the Java GUI to create an interface for the chat bot and used Java as the programming language that is used to develop this chat bot.

 ## Chosen SDLC: Waterfall Model
 
The software development cycle that we decided to work on is the waterfall model as for small deliverable projects waterfall model is convenient. As we are developing a small chat-bot whose requirements are clear, the project is short and simple, waterfall model seemed like a good fit for this project. This model is also very easy to understand as the steps are straightforward and avoids any confusion as it takes a more linear approach to the completion of the project.<br>
On the other hand, this model does slow down the process as the team needs to complete a step before moving on to the next one which often overlooks revision or any unexpected errors.

**WATER-FALL MODEL:**
1. PLANNING:
   -	Requirements
   - Project scope.
2.	DESIGN:
    -	User-friendly design
    -	User approval
    - Revision
3.	IMPLEMENTATION:
    - Developing phase
    -	Error-Handling
4. DEPLOYMENT:
5. MAINTAINENECE
